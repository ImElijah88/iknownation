### Documentation: `config/db_config.php`

**Objective:**
This file serves as the central configuration hub for database connection parameters and sensitive API keys used throughout the Now Nation application.

**File Path:**
`config/db_config.php`

**Key Functionality:**

*   **Database Credentials:**
    *   Defines essential variables for connecting to the MySQL database: `$servername`, `$username`, `$password`, and `$dbname`.
    *   These are typically set for a local development environment (e.g., XAMPP defaults) and should be managed securely in a production environment.

*   **Database Connection Establishment:**
    *   Initializes a new `mysqli` object to establish a connection to the specified database.

*   **Connection Validation:**
    *   Includes error handling to check if the database connection was successful.
    *   If the connection fails, it terminates the script and outputs a JSON error message (suitable for API calls) or a `die()` message (for direct page access).

*   **LLM API Key:**
    *   Defines the `LLM_API_KEY` as a PHP constant.
    *   This key is crucial for authenticating requests to the external Large Language Model (LLM) service (e.g., OpenRouter).
    *   It is explicitly marked as sensitive and should be kept secure.

**Dependencies:**

*   This file is a core dependency and is included by almost all PHP scripts that interact with the database or the LLM API (e.g., `api/auth.php`, `api/generate_presentation.php`, `components/session_manager.php`).

### Future Improvements:

*   **Environment Variables:** For production, store sensitive credentials (DB password, API key) in environment variables rather than directly in the file.
*   **Configuration Management:** Consider a more robust configuration management system for complex applications.
