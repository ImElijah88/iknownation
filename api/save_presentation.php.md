### Documentation: `api/save_presentation.php`

**Objective:**
This API endpoint updates the status of a user's presentation from 'temporary' to 'saved' in the database.

**File Path:**
`api/save_presentation.php`

**Key Functionality:**

*   **Access Control:**
    *   Ensures that only logged-in users can save presentations.
    *   Relies on `components/session_manager.php` for user login status verification.

*   **Input Handling:**
    *   Accepts a `POST` request with a JSON payload containing the `id` of the presentation to be saved.

*   **Permission Check:**
    *   Before updating, it verifies that the presentation identified by the `id` actually belongs to the currently logged-in user.

*   **Database Update:**
    *   Updates the `status` column of the specified presentation in the `presentations` table to `'saved'`.

*   **JSON Response:**
    *   Returns a JSON response indicating success or failure of the save operation.

**Dependencies:**

*   `config/db_config.php`: For database connection.
*   `components/session_manager.php`: For user authentication and session management.

**Front-end Interaction:**

*   Used by `assets/js/my_profile.js` when a user clicks the "Save" button for a newly generated (temporary) presentation in their "Content Vault".

### Future Improvements:

*   **Error Handling:** Implement more specific error messages for database update failures.
*   **Logging:** Log save events.
