Plan: Get Presentations API
Objective: Create a PHP script that fetches presentation data from the database and returns it as JSON. This API will serve content to the main application.

File to Create: get_presentations.php

Key Functionality:

✅ Database Connection: Include the database configuration and connect to the nownation database.

✅ Fetch Logic:

✅ It should accept an optional user_id as a GET parameter (e.g., get_presentations.php?user_id=123).

✅ If a user_id is provided, the SQL query should fetch all presentations where user_id is NULL (default presentations) OR where user_id matches the provided ID.

✅ If no user_id is provided, the query should fetch only the default presentations (user_id IS NULL).

✅ Data Formatting:

✅ Loop through the SQL results.

✅ For each presentation, decode the slides, quizzes, and colors JSON strings into PHP arrays/objects.

✅ Format the final output into a single JSON object, where the keys are the presentation_key values.

✅ Output: echo the final JSON object.

✅ Headers: Set the Content-Type header to application/json.

### Future Improvements:

✅ **Pagination/Filtering:** Added options for pagination.
✅ **Error Handling:** Implemented more detailed error messages for API failures.
✅ **Caching:** Implemented server-side caching for frequently accessed presentations to improve performance.
