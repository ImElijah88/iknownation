The water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle, describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. The main stages are evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection.
Evaporation: Water turns from a liquid to a gas.
Condensation: Water vapor in the air gets cold and changes back into liquid, forming clouds.
Precipitation: Water falls from the clouds as rain, snow, sleet, or hail.
Collection: Water collects in rivers, lakes, oceans, or underground.
