The Micro-SaaS Factory: Master Plan & Operational Protocol
Version 1.2

1. The Philosophy & Mission
   The mission of the Micro-SaaS Factory is to rapidly design, build, test, and deploy single-purpose, high-value web applications. We achieve this by leveraging a highly disciplined, autonomous AI development team operating under a strict set of protocols.

Our core philosophy is Automated Agile Development (AAD). We build in rapid, iterative cycles, focusing on completing one small, perfect feature at a time. This maximizes momentum, minimizes complex debugging, and produces consistent, high-quality results.

Guiding Principle: Functionality First. Our focus is on raw utility. We are building the "Model T" of AI applicationsâ€”the reliable Autodenken ("Self-Thinkers" or "Cars of the Mind") that get the job done. The UI/UX will be clean, professional, and intuitive, but our primary investment is in the power, reliability, and efficiency of the engine under the hood.

2. The Universal Toolkit
   All projects built in this factory will be constructed using a standardized, free-to-use, and powerful toolkit. The AI development team is expected to be proficient with the following technologies:

IDE: Visual Studio Code

Version Control: Git & GitHub

AI Gateway: OpenRouter (ensuring model independence and access to free tiers)

AI Orchestrator: LangChain (for Python-based AI logic)

AI Interfaces: Gemini CLI (or a universal alternative like oat) & VS Code Chat

Containerization: Docker (to ensure perfect environment consistency)

Backend: Python with Flask or FastAPI (the "MCP Server")

Database: PostgreSQL (powerful, free, and Docker-friendly)

Authentication: Free-tier services (e.g., Supabase, Firebase Authentication) for secure, pre-built login systems (including Google Auth).

Package Managers: npm (frontend), pip (Python).

3. The Master Protocol Suite
   The factory operates on a suite of interconnected protocols. These .md files are the "brains" of the AI team, guiding every phase of the development lifecycle.

PROJECT_ARCHITECT.MD (Phase 1: Planning): The master protocol for defining a new project's goals, technology stack, and architecture. Its final output is the project-specific GEMINI.MD constitution.

Designer.md (Phase 2: Design): The UI/UX protocol. It contains the style guide, design principles, and accessibility checklists to ensure a high-quality, professional frontend.

man_at_work.md (Phase 3: Development): The main autonomous operational loop. This protocol commands the AI to systematically select, build, and document tasks from the project's to-do list.

QA_PROTOCOL.MD (Phase 4: Testing): The Quality Assurance protocol. It forces the AI to write and run automated tests for every new feature, ensuring code is reliable and bug-free.

DEBUGGING_PROTOCOL.MD (Sub-Protocol): The specialized "brain" for troubleshooting. It's activated by the QA or main work protocols when an error is encountered.

RESULTS_VERIFICATION.MD (Sub-Protocol): The "eyes" of the AI. It forces the agent to define and check for the expected outcomes of its work.

DEPLOYMENT_PROTOCOL.MD (Phase 5: Deployment): The final protocol. It handles containerizing the completed application with Docker and pushing a versioned, well-documented release to GitHub.

HUMAN_ASSISTANCE_REQUIRED.MD (The Intervention Log): The AI's communication channel. This is where it logs issues it cannot solve, creating a targeted to-do list for human oversight.

4. The Production Workflow: Building a New App
   To build a new application from the ground up, you will follow this exact five-step process:

Step 1: Create a New Project Folder.

Step 2: Deploy the Protocol Suite. Copy the entire suite of master protocol .md files into the new, empty folder.

Step 3: Initiate the Architect. Open the Gemini CLI in the folder and activate the architect to begin the planning phase:

"Activate the PROJECT_ARCHITECT.MD protocol to design our new application."

Step 4: Begin Autonomous Development. Once the architect has completed its work and generated the project-specific GEMINI.MD, activate the lead developer:

"Activate the man_at_work.md protocol. Begin the autonomous development loop."

Step 5: Monitor & Assist. The AI will now build the application. Your role is to periodically check the HUMAN_ASSISTANCE_REQUIRED.MD file and provide the necessary fixes or decisions to keep the project moving forward.

This document is the master plan. It provides the focus, the tools, and the repeatable process to turn your vision into a series of tangible, high-quality products.
