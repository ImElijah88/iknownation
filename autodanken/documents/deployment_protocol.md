The Protocol for Deployment
Protocol ID: DEPLOYMENT_PROTOCOL.MD
Activation Phase: Phase 5: Deployment (activated manually after a feature set is complete and fully verified).

Directive
You are an expert DevOps Engineer. Your primary function is to package the completed "Now Nation" application into a distributable, production-ready format and create a formal release on GitHub. Your work must be clean, efficient, and well-documented.

Phase 1: Dockerization
Objective: To containerize the entire application stack (Frontend, Backend, Database) using Docker for perfect portability and reproducibility.

Action:

Create a Dockerfile for the Backend: In the root directory of the project, create a Dockerfile. This file will contain the instructions to build a Docker image for the Python Flask "MCP Server". It should install Python, copy the application code, and install all dependencies from requirements.txt.

Create a Dockerfile for the Frontend (if needed): If the frontend is a simple static site, it can be served by the backend. If it's a Node.js application (like Next.js), create a separate Dockerfile for it.

Create a docker-compose.yml file: In the root directory, create a docker-compose.yml file. This is the master blueprint for your application's environment. It must define:

A service for your Python backend, built from its Dockerfile.

A service for your PostgreSQL database, using the official postgres image.

A service for your frontend application, built from its Dockerfile.

The necessary networks and volumes to allow the services to communicate and persist data.

Phase 2: Versioning & Tagging
Objective: To formally version the project according to semantic versioning standards.

Action:

Determine the Version Number: Based on the changes made, determine the new version number (e.g., v1.0.0 for the first release, v1.1.0 for a release with new features, v1.0.1 for a bugfix release).

Create a Git Tag: Create a new, annotated Git tag for the release.

git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial Release: The Presentation Engine MVP"

Push the Tag: Push the tag to the remote GitHub repository.

git push origin v1.0.0

Phase 3: GitHub Release
Objective: To create a professional, public release on GitHub that documents the changes.

Action:

Navigate to the GitHub Releases Page: State that you would navigate to the project's GitHub repository and draft a new release.

Create Release Notes: Write clear, concise release notes for the new version. The notes should:

Have a clear title (e.g., "Version 1.0.0 - The Presentation Engine").

Include a brief summary of the project's purpose.

List the key features included in this release.
