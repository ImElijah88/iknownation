Now Nation: Final Blueprint & Development Plan
Objective: This document provides the complete architectural plan and step-by-step instructions for building the Now Nation application. It is designed to be the single source of truth for any developer executing this project.

1. The Vision: Product Requirements
   The application is a dynamic, user-centric presentation tool.

Guests: Can view and interact with a default, gamified presentation.

Registered Users: Can customize their workspace by adding/removing presentations, and can access a profile page to generate, save, and manage their own unique presentations using an integrated LLM.

Admins: Can access a special page to create new presentation templates.

Technology: The entire application will run on a local server (like XAMPP) using PHP and a MySQL database.

2. The Architecture: Final Folder Structure
   To ensure the code is clean, modular, and conflict-free, the project will be organized into the following folder structure. This separation of concerns is critical for a successful build.

/NowNation/
|
|-- assets/ # For all front-end CSS and JavaScript
| |-- css/
| | |-- style.css
| |-- js/
| |-- main.js
| |-- nownation.js
| |-- my_profile.js
|
|-- components/ # For reusable back-end PHP components
| |-- header.php
| |-- sidemenu.php
| |-- session_manager.php
|
|-- api/ # For back-end scripts that handle data requests
| |-- get_presentations.php
| |-- generate_presentation.php
| |-- create_template.php
| |-- export.php
|
|-- config/ # For application configuration
| |-- db_config.php
|
|-- database/ # For the SQL setup script
| |-- database_setup.sql
|
|-- nownation.php # Main application page (viewer)
|-- my_profile.php # User profile & content creation page
|-- admin_templates.php # Admin-only template creation page
|-- logout.php # Script to handle user logout

This document is the master plan you envisioned. It's structured to be given to any developer—human or AI—so they can understand the architecture and execute your vision flawlessly, one step at a time. It combines the high-level PRD with our detailed technical architecture decisions into one comprehensive guide.

Here is the final blueprint for the Now Nation application.

3. Core Concepts & Instructions
   This section explains how the different parts of the application work together.

3.1. Database Configuration (config/db_config.php)
Purpose: To hold the database connection details ($servername, $username, $password, $dbname) in one single, secure place.

Instruction: Every PHP script that needs to connect to the database (all API files and the main pages with login logic) must start by including this file: require 'config/db_config.php';.

3.2. Security & User Roles (components/session_manager.php)
Purpose: To manage who is logged in and what they are allowed to do.

Instruction:

This file contains the functions isLoggedIn(), isAdmin(), and getCurrentUser().

Any page that requires a user to be logged in (like my_profile.php) or to be an admin (like admin_templates.php) must include this file at the very top and use these functions to check for clearance. If the check fails, the user must be redirected.

3.3. The PHP-to-JavaScript Hand-off (The APP_USER Variable)
Purpose: To securely inform the front-end JavaScript about the current user's status without needing extra API calls.

Instruction:

The header.php component is responsible for this. It will include session_manager.php and then create a global JavaScript variable.

The code is: <script>const APP_USER = <?php echo json_encode(getCurrentUser()); ?>;</script>.

The global main.js script will then use this APP_USER variable to dynamically change the UI (e.g., showing "Login" vs. "My Profile" buttons).

3.4. CSS & JavaScript Management
Purpose: To prevent style and script conflicts.

Instruction:

CSS: The global assets/css/style.css file is loaded in the <head> of every page. All other styling should be done with Tailwind CSS utility classes.

JavaScript: Scripts must be loaded at the bottom of the <body> in a specific order:

Load assets/js/main.js first on every page. It handles the logic for the shared header and sidemenu.

Load the page-specific script (e.g., assets/js/nownation.js on nownation.php) second. This ensures the global functions are available before the page-specific code tries to use them.

4. Step-by-Step Execution Plan
   This is the recommended order of operations for building the application.

Setup the Environment:

Create the folder structure detailed above.

Run the database/database_setup.sql script in phpMyAdmin to create the tables.

Create the config/db_config.php file with the correct database credentials.

Build the Core Components:

Create the components/session_manager.php file.

Create the components/header.php file, including the APP_USER script tag.

Create the components/sidemenu.php file.

Build the Back-End APIs:

Create the api/get_presentations.php script to fetch data.

Create the other API placeholders (generate_presentation.php, etc.).

Build the Front-End Pages & Logic:

Create the assets/css/style.css and assets/js/main.js files.

Build the nownation.php page, include the components, and then create its specific assets/js/nownation.js file.

Build the my_profile.php page, include the components, and then create its specific assets/js/my_profile.js file.

Build the admin_templates.php page and its logic.

Test and Refine:

Thoroughly test each feature, from guest view to admin creation, ensuring the logic in each file works as planned.
