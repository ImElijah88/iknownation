### Documentation: `admin_templates.php`

**Objective:**
This file serves as the admin-only interface for creating and managing presentation templates within the Now Nation application.

**File Path:**
`admin_templates.php`

**Key Functionality:**

*   **Access Control:**
    *   Ensures that only users with the 'admin' role can access this page. If a non-admin user attempts to access it, they are redirected to `nownation.php`.
    *   Relies on `components/session_manager.php` for user role verification.

*   **Modular Includes:**
    *   Includes `components/header.php` for the global header, modals (login, profile), and theme toggling.
    *   Includes `components/sidemenu.php` for the main navigation sidebar.
    *   This ensures a consistent UI and leverages reusable components.

*   **HTML Structure:**
    *   Provides the form (`#template-creator-form`) for administrators to input details for new templates, including:
        *   Template Name (text input)
        *   Description (textarea)
        *   Features (checkboxes for defining template characteristics like quizzes, tone, etc.).
    *   Includes a status area (`#generation-status`) to display feedback during the template creation process.
    *   Contains a placeholder section (`#existing-templates-list`) for dynamically displaying a list of templates already in the database.

*   **Dependencies:**
    *   `components/session_manager.php`
    *   `components/header.php`
    *   `components/sidemenu.php`
    *   `assets/js/main.js` (for global UI, modals, notifications)
    *   (Future: `assets/js/admin_templates.js` for page-specific JS logic)
    *   (Future: `api/create_template.php` for form submission)
    *   (Future: `api/get_all_templates.php` for listing existing templates)

### Future Improvements:

*   **Implement JavaScript for Form Submission:** Develop `assets/js/admin_templates.js` to handle form submission to `api/create_template.php`.
*   **Implement Listing Existing Templates:** Fetch and display existing templates from the database in the `#existing-templates-list` section.
*   **Edit/Delete Templates:** Add functionality to edit or delete existing templates.
*   **Dynamic Feature Input:** Improve the "Features" section to allow more flexible input (e.g., text fields for `max_slides`, dropdowns for `style` options) rather than just checkboxes.
*   **LLM Integration for Template Creation:** Integrate `api/create_template.php` with an LLM to generate more complex template structures based on admin input.
