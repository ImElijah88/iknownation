## Docker Connection Error - Human Assistance Required

**Original Error Message (Attempt 1):**
```
error during connect: Head "http://%2F%2F.%2Fpipe%2FdockerDesktopLinuxEngine/_ping": open //./pipe/dockerDesktopLinuxEngine: The system cannot find the file specified.
```

**Original Error Message (Attempt 2 - after Docker Desktop was confirmed to be on):**
```
request returned 500 Internal Server Error for API route and version http://%2F%2F.%2Fpipe%2FdockerDesktopLinuxEngine/_ping, check if the server supports the requested API version
```

**Hypotheses Tested:**
1. The `docker-compose build` command failed because the Docker daemon (Docker Desktop) was not running or was not properly configured to be accessible from the command line.
2. Docker Desktop is running, but there's an internal issue preventing the Docker client from communicating correctly with the Docker daemon, possibly a corrupted installation or a service not fully initialized.

**Code Changes Attempted for Each Fix:**
No code changes were attempted as this is an environmental issue requiring manual intervention.

**Human intervention is required to proceed with this task.** Please try **restarting Docker Desktop completely**. If the issue persists after a restart, a reinstallation of Docker Desktop might be necessary.
